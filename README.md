# Leet Code Solutions

This is just a repo for keeping track of my Leet Code progress.

Essentially i want to see my growth over time, want to try out new languages, discover new algos and that kind of stuff.

## Two Sum Problem

At first, i came up with a brute-force-ish O(n^2) solution, then i read through other solutions and came up with the worst case scenario being O(n) solution using hashmap.

## Add Two Numbers

Nailed it first try, it just randomly popped right into my head that i should use school's vertical addition algorithm.
